# give_me_the_banner

This a simple code I've been modifing from a hacking tutorial that let me works and understand some basics concepts on how to make connections to ip address, and for this particulary case to do a simple banner grabber to find vulns!

How to use the script:
----------------------

You will need to call the script with an argument, passing to it the network portion of the IP Address (e.g 192.168.1)

python3 get_banner.py 192.168.1

Notes:
------
If there are not coincidences the script will works as well but indicanting there ir an error.
The same will occurs if there is a problem with the connection to an ip address.
